# Patient Barbara

Barbara, 36-year old woman with failure of an internal organ. The disease reduces quality of her life by 50% related to full health. If she resignes from treatment she is expected to live only two years. After successful transplant the expected lifespan rises up to four years with 80% quality of life. The cost of the transplantation is 100k USD plus follow-up treatment (drugs, followup admissions and visits) is 10k/year. The risk of failure of the operation (transplant rejection and immediate death) is 15%.

- Q1. *What is the cost of additional year of life without quality-of-life correction?*
- Q2. *What is the cost of one additional year of life with quality-of-life correction and a 5% discont rate?*
